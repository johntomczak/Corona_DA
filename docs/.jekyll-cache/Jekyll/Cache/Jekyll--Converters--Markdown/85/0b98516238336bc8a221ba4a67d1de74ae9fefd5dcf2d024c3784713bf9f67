I"Ÿ<p>I am not really sure where I came across this dataset. Like the rest of us, I have been consuming a lot of media this ~week. I think the link came up on Hacker News and an email newsletter and a few times on Twitter. Regardless, I finally clicked it, and was quickly taken in. Restaurants seatings seem like a fairly good proxy for social activity. Not sure that that presumption needs a lot of explanation.</p>
